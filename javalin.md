# Javalin Web Framework

Javalin is a lightweight web framework for Java and Kotlin.

## Overview

Javalin was created by Tatu Saloranta, a Finnish developer known for his contributions to the Java community. It provides a simple and minimalistic approach to web application development, making it an excellent choice for projects that prioritize simplicity and agility.

## Key Features

- **Simplicity and Minimalism**: Javalin offers an intuitive and concise API, making it easy to get started with web development without the complexity of extensive configurations.

- **Kotlin Integration**: While compatible with Java, Javalin is particularly popular among Kotlin developers due to its expressive syntax.

- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: You can choose the libraries and tools you want to use, making it suitable for custom projects with specific requirements.

- **Simple Routing**: Javalin simplifies defining routes for handling HTTP requests. Here's an example in Kotlin:

   ```kotlin
   import io.javalin.Javalin

   fun main() {
       val app = Javalin.create().start(7000)

       app.get("/") { ctx ->
           ctx.result("Hello, World!")
       }
   }
   ```

- **WebSocket Support**: Javalin includes built-in support for WebSockets, allowing you to build real-time applications.

- **Plugin System**: Javalin offers a plugin system for extending the framework's capabilities with additional features.

## Choosing Javalin

When choosing between Javalin and other Java web frameworks like Spring Boot, consider your project's specific requirements. Javalin excels in smaller projects and simple web applications where simplicity and speed of development are paramount. In contrast, Spring Boot provides a comprehensive Java ecosystem with features like dependency injection and Java Persistence API (JPA) support.
